# CNN
The approach starts with a static input image and  a convolution layer, flatten layers,pooling layer, and dense layer will be added to the CNN model.  The dataset, fer2013, was obtained via Kaggle.
There are 48 grayscale photos of faces in this dataset. It includes happy, sad, and other emotions. furious, surprise, and terror with 27,859 training images and 3765 testing images purpose. We used a big dataset to train for improved accuracy, and the outcome is an object class for an object. Picture input For training and testing, we used two picture generators.
Then all of the tests and training are pre-processed. Model structure was designed by us. By building a model with the.h5 extension, the features will be retrieved using the pooling method.
The model that was built for testing purposes is then used . For facial recognition, we use OpenCV. Real-time testing requires recognition.
